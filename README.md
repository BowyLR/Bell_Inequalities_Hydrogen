# Bell_Inequalities_Hydrogen
We investigate if the family of Bell inequalities constructed from spin Hamiltonians, acquired with the Jordan-Wigner and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation, are equivalent or inequivalent to eachother. 
Moreover, we also investigate if the ground states of the corresponding spin Hamiltonians show nonlocal correlations.
To get a better understanding of the code and how the simulations are done, it is recommended to read the [report](./report_final_version.pdf)
The repository is devided into two folders.
## Code
The [code](./code) folder contains the code used to do the simulations.
The respective functions all contain a detailed description of what they do, what their input and what their outputs are.

## Data
Contains the data saved from the simulations and the figures.
